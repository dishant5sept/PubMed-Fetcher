40073425,Assessing Total Hip Arthroplasty Outcomes and Generating an Orthopedic Research Outcome Database via a Natural Language Processing Pipeline: Development and Validation Study.,"Nicholas H Mast, Clara L Oeste, Dries Hens","Processing data from electronic health records (EHRs) to build research-grade databases is a lengthy and expensive process. Modern arthroplasty practice commonly uses multiple sites of care, including clinics and ambulatory care centers. However, most private data systems prevent obtaining usable insights for clinical practice."
40073394,Integrating Ambient In-Home Sensor Data and Electronic Health Record Data for the Prediction of Outcomes in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Protocol for an Exploratory Feasibility Study.,"William E Janes, Noah Marchal, Xing Song, Mihail Popescu, Abu Saleh Mohammad Mosa, Juliana H Earwood, Vovanti Jones, Marjorie Skubic",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) leads to rapid physiological and functional decline before causing untimely death. Current best-practice approaches to interdisciplinary care are unable to provide adequate monitoring of patients' health. Passive in-home sensor systems enable 24×7 health monitoring. Combining sensor data with outcomes extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) through a supervised machine learning algorithm may enable health care providers to predict and ultimately slow decline among people living with ALS.

40073281,An Integrated Fuzzy Neural Network and Topological Data Analysis for Molecular Graph Representation Learning and Property Forecasting.,Phu Pham,"Within a recent decade, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful neural architecture for various graph-structured data modelling and task-driven representation learning problems. Recent studies have highlighted the remarkable capabilities of GNNs in handling complex graph representation learning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in node/graph classification, regression, and generation. However, most traditional GNN-based architectures like GCN and GraphSAGE still faced several challenges related to the capability of preserving the multi-scaled topological structures. These models primarily focus on capturing local neighborhood information, often failing to retain global structural features essential for graph-level representation and classification tasks. Furthermore, their expressiveness is limited when learning topological structures in complex molecular graph datasets. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we proposed a novel graph neural architecture which is an integration between neuro-fuzzy network and topological graph learning approach, naming as: FTPG. Specifically, within our proposed FTPG model, we introduce a novel approach to molecular graph representation and property prediction by integrating multi-scaled topological graph learning with advanced neural components. The architecture employs separate graph neural learning modules to effectively capture both local graph-based structures as well as global topological features. Moreover, to further address feature uncertainty in the global-view representation, a multi-layered neuro-fuzzy network is incorporated within our model to enhance the robustness and expressiveness of the learned molecular graph embeddings. This combinatorial approach can assist to leverage the strengths of multi-view and multi-modal neural learning, enabling FTPG to deliver superior performance in molecular graph tasks. Extensive experiments on real-world/benchmark molecular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FTPG model. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based baselines categorized in different approaches, including canonical local proximity message passing based, graph transformer-based, and topology-driven approaches."

40073146,A flexible pressure sensor array for self-powered identity authentication during typing.,"Tongtong Zhang, Farid Manshaii, Chris R Bowen, Maoyi Zhang, Weiqi Qian, Chaosheng Hu, Yanan Bai, Zhijie Huang, Ya Yang, Jun Chen","The keyboard, a staple tool for information entry and human-machine interaction, faces demands for enhanced information security due to evolving internet technologies. This study introduces a self-powered flexible intelligent keyboard (SFIK) that harnesses the giant magnetoelastic effect to convert the mechanical pressure from key presses into electrical signals. The sensor boasts a wide sensing range (35 to 600 kPa) and a rapid response time (∼300 ms), allowing it to record and recognize individual keystroke dynamics. Integrated with machine learning, this keyboard enables identity authentication through both fixed- and dynamic-text inputs. It accurately authenticates fixed passwords of eight characters with a 95.3% success rate and dynamic text from 14 sets of double keys with 100% accuracy. Given its capabilities, the SFIK offers promising applications in artificial intelligence, network security, and access control for computers and networks."

40073052,Machine-learning heat flux closure for multi-moment fluid modeling of nonlinear Landau damping.,"Ziyu Huang, Chuanfei Dong, Liang Wang","Nonlinear plasma physics problems are usually simulated through comprehensive modeling of phase space. The extreme computational cost of such simulations has motivated the development of multi-moment fluid models. However, a major challenge has been finding a suitable fluid closure for these fluid models. Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning have led to a renewed interest in constructing accurate fluid closure terms. In this study, we take an approach that integrates kinetic physics from the first-principles Vlasov simulations into a fluid model (through the heat flux closure term) using the Fourier neural operator-a neural network architecture. Without resolving the phase space dynamics, this new fluid model is capable of capturing the nonlinear evolution of the Landau damping process that exactly matches the Vlasov simulation results. This machine learning-assisted new approach provides a computationally affordable framework that surpasses previous fluid models in accurately modeling the kinetic evolution of complex plasma systems."
